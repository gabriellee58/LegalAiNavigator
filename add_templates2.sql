GRANT OF CONSERVATION EASEMENT\n\n1.1 The Landowner hereby voluntarily grants and conveys to the Conservation Organization, and the Conservation Organization hereby accepts, a conservation easement in perpetuity over the Protected Property of the nature and character and to the extent set forth herein (the "Conservation Easement").\n\n1.2 This Conservation Easement is created pursuant to the applicable conservation easement legislation in the Province of {{province}}.\n\n## 2. PURPOSE\n\n2.1 The purpose of this Conservation Easement is to ensure that the Protected Property will be retained forever predominantly in its natural, scenic, forested, agricultural, and/or open space condition; to protect any rare plants, animals, or plant communities on the Protected Property; and to prevent any use of the Protected Property that will significantly impair or interfere with the Conservation Values of the Protected Property (the "Purpose").\n\n## 3. RIGHTS OF CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION\n\n3.1 The Conservation Organization shall have the following rights:\n\n(a) To preserve and protect the Conservation Values of the Protected Property;\n\n(b) To enter upon the Protected Property at reasonable times in order to monitor compliance with and otherwise enforce the terms of this Conservation Easement; provided that such entry shall be upon prior reasonable notice to Landowner, and the Conservation Organization shall not unreasonably interfere with Landowner\'s use and quiet enjoyment of the Protected Property;\n\n(c) To prevent any activity on or use of the Protected Property that is inconsistent with the Purpose of this Conservation Easement and to require the restoration of such areas or features of the Protected Property that may be damaged by any inconsistent activity or use; and\n\n(d) To require that the Landowner\'s reserved rights be exercised in a manner that does not impair the Conservation Values.\n\n## 4.

TAXES\n\n9.1 The Landowner shall pay all taxes and assessments levied against the Protected Property.\n\n## 10. EXTINGUISHMENT\n\n10.1 If circumstances arise in the future that render the Purpose of this Conservation Easement impossible to accomplish, this Conservation Easement can only be terminated or extinguished, whether in whole or in part, by judicial proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n## 11. ASSIGNMENT\n\n11.1 This Conservation Easement is transferable, but the Conservation Organization may assign its rights and obligations under this Conservation Easement only to an organization that is a qualified organization at the time of transfer under the applicable conservation easement legislation, and authorized to acquire and hold conservation easements.\n\n## 12. SUBSEQUENT TRANSFERS\n\n12.1 The Landowner agrees to incorporate the terms of this Conservation Easement in any deed or other legal instrument by which it divests itself of any interest in all or a portion of the Protected Property, including, without limitation, a leasehold interest.\n\n## 13. GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n13.1 **Governing Law**: This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of {{province}} and the laws of Canada applicable therein.\n\n13.2 **Severability**: If any provision of this Agreement, or its application to any person or circumstance, is found to be invalid, the remainder of the provisions of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is found to be invalid, shall not be affected.\n\n13.3 **Entire Agreement**: This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the Conservation Easement and supersedes all prior discussions, negotiations, understandings, or agreements relating to the Conservation Easement, all of which are merged herein.\n\n13.4 **Joint Obligation**: The obligations imposed by this Agreement upon the Landowner shall be joint and several.\n\n13.5 **Captions**: The captions in this Agreement have been inserted solely for convenience of reference and are not a part of this Agreement and shall have no effect upon its construction or interpretation.\n\n13.6 **Counterparts**: The Parties may execute this Agreement in two or more counterparts, which shall, in the aggregate, be signed by both Parties; each counterpart shall be deemed an original instrument as against any party who has signed it.
