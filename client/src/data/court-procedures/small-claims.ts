  faq: [
    {
      question: "Do I need a lawyer for Small Claims Court?",
      answer: "No, Small Claims Court is designed to be accessible without legal representation. Many people successfully represent themselves. However, you may benefit from consulting a lawyer for initial advice or in more complex cases. Some provinces (like Quebec) actually prohibit lawyer representation in Small Claims hearings."
    },
    {
      question: "What types of disputes can be heard in Small Claims Court?",
      answer: "Small Claims Court handles most civil monetary disputes under the jurisdictional limit, including unpaid debts, property damage, consumer complaints, breach of contract, and some landlord-tenant issues. It cannot handle family matters, land ownership disputes, wills and estates, or injunctions. Jurisdictions vary slightly by province."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost to file a Small Claims case?",
      answer: "Filing fees typically range from $100 to $300, depending on the claim amount and province. Additional costs may include service fees ($30-100), fees for filing motions or enforcement documents, and potentially expert witness fees. Fee waiver programs exist for those with financial need in most provinces."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a Small Claims case take?",
      answer: "The timeframe varies by province and case complexity, but typically ranges from 6-12 months from filing to trial. Settlement conferences usually occur 3-6 months after filing. Simple or uncontested matters may resolve more quickly. Delays can occur in busy court districts."
    },
    {
      question: "What if the defendant doesn't respond to my claim?",
      answer: "If the defendant fails to respond within the required timeframe (typically 20-30 days), you can request a default judgment from the court. This process varies by province but generally requires filing an affidavit confirming proper service and lack of response, followed by a request for judgment."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I win but the defendant doesn't pay?",
      answer: "Winning a judgment doesn't automatically guarantee payment. If the defendant doesn't voluntarily pay, you must take enforcement steps, which may include garnishment of wages or bank accounts, seizure and sale of property, or examination of the debtor about their assets. Each enforcement method requires additional court filings and fees."
