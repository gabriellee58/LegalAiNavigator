      question: "What is the difference between a tribunal and a court?",
      answer: "Administrative tribunals are specialized bodies created by legislation to resolve disputes in specific domains. Unlike courts, tribunals have limited jurisdiction, more flexible procedures, typically lower costs, and decision-makers with subject-matter expertise rather than judges. Their procedures are less formal, they can act more proactively in investigations, and they often emphasize accessibility for self-represented parties."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a lawyer for a tribunal hearing?",
      answer: "While not required, legal representation can be beneficial for complex cases. Many people successfully represent themselves before tribunals, which are designed to be more accessible than courts. Some tribunals (like Quebec Small Claims) prohibit lawyers, while others allow non-lawyer representatives like paralegals, union representatives, or community advocates. Many tribunals provide resources to help self-represented parties."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost to file a tribunal application?",
      answer: "Filing fees vary by tribunal but are typically lower than court fees, ranging from free to about $200. Human rights complaints are often free to file. Some tribunals, like landlord-tenant boards, charge different fees based on application type. Fee waiver programs are available for those with financial need. Additional costs may include document preparation, expert reports, and legal advice."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a tribunal process take?",
      answer: "Timeframes vary significantly by tribunal and case complexity, ranging from 3-18 months from application to decision. Simpler matters with active case management may resolve in 3-6 months. More complex cases with multiple parties or legal issues may take a year or longer. Some tribunals offer expedited processes for urgent matters. Case backlogs can cause additional delays."
    },
    {
      question: "What remedies can tribunals provide?",
      answer: "Remedies depend on the tribunal's enabling legislation but may include: monetary compensation (including damages for discrimination in human rights contexts), ordering specific actions (reinstatement, accommodation, rule changes), declaratory relief (formal findings about legal rights), licensing decisions, and public interest remedies (training, policy development). Unlike courts, tribunals cannot generally award punitive damages or make Charter declarations."
    },
    {
      question: "Are tribunal decisions binding and enforceable?",
      answer: "Yes, tribunal decisions are legally binding and enforceable, though enforcement mechanisms vary. Most tribunal orders can be filed with a court to be enforced like court orders. Some tribunals (like human rights tribunals) may monitor compliance with remedial orders. Parties who don't comply may face contempt proceedings or additional penalties. Decisions may be appealed or judicially reviewed only on specific grounds."
