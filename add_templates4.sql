('tax', 'gst-hst', 'GST/HST Registration Guide', 'Guide for registering for GST/HST in Canada', 'en', '# GST/HST REGISTRATION GUIDE\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nThis guide provides information on GST/HST registration requirements for businesses operating in Canada. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a federal tax of 5% on most goods and services in Canada. The Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) combines the GST with provincial sales tax in participating provinces, with rates varying by province.\n\n## DETERMINING IF YOU NEED TO REGISTER\n\n### Mandatory Registration\n\nYou must register for GST/HST if:\n\n1. You provide taxable supplies in Canada; and\n2. You are not a small supplier (see below); and\n3. You are not specifically exempted from registration.\n\n### Small Supplier Status\n\nYou are considered a small supplier if your total worldwide revenues from taxable supplies (before expenses) did not exceed {{smallSupplierThreshold}} in the last four consecutive calendar quarters or in any single calendar quarter.\n\nExceptions to small supplier status:\n- Taxi operators and commercial ride-sharing services must register regardless of revenue\n- Non-resident performers selling admissions to seminars, performances, etc. in Canada\n- Non-resident businesses selling taxable supplies in Canada\n\n### Voluntary Registration\n\nYou may choose to register voluntarily if you are a small supplier making taxable supplies in Canada. Benefits of voluntary registration may include:\n- Ability to claim Input Tax Credits (ITCs) on business purchases\n- Avoiding the need to retroactively register and account for GST/HST if your revenues exceed the threshold\n- Appearing more established to business clients\n\n## TYPES OF SUPPLIES FOR GST/HST PURPOSES\n\n### Taxable Supplies (5%, 13%, 15% depending on province)\n- Most goods and services\n\n### Zero-Rated Supplies (0% GST/HST)\n- Basic groceries\n- Agricultural products\n- Prescription drugs\n- Medical devices\n- Exports\n\n### Exempt Supplies (No GST/HST)\n- Health care services\n- Educational services\n- Financial services\n- Long-term residential accommodation\n- Child care services\n\n## GST/HST RATES BY PROVINCE/TERRITORY\n\n| Province/Territory | Tax | Rate |\n|-------------------|-----|------|\n| Alberta | GST | 5% |\n| British Columbia | GST | 5% |\n| Manitoba | GST | 5% |\n| New Brunswick | HST | 15% |\n| Newfoundland and Labrador | HST | 15% |\n| Northwest Territories | GST | 5% |\n| Nova Scotia | HST | 15% |\n| Nunavut | GST | 5% |\n| Ontario | HST | 13% |\n| Prince Edward Island | HST | 15% |\n| Quebec | GST + QST | 5% + 9.975% |\n| Saskatchewan | GST | 5% |\n| Yukon | GST | 5% |\n\n## HOW TO REGISTER FOR GST/HST\n\n### Information Required\n\nTo register, you will need:\n\n1.

with the Appeals Officer's decision, you generally have 90 days from the date of the Notice of Confirmation or Reassessment to file an appeal with the Tax Court of Canada.\n\n7. **Burden of Proof**: The taxpayer generally bears the burden of disproving the CRA's assumptions that formed the basis of the assessment.', '[{"name":"currentDate","label":"Current
