It should not include:\n- Statements about offences for which the offender was not convicted\n- Allegations of other criminal acts committed by the offender\n- Comments about the offender's character unrelated to the offence\n- Recommendations about the sentence\n\nThe statement will be disclosed to the Crown, the offender, and the offender's lawyer. You may be questioned about the content of your statement during the sentencing hearing.\n\nYou have the right to read your Victim Impact Statement aloud in court if you wish. You may also request to present your statement by:\n- Reading it behind a screen or outside the courtroom by closed-circuit television\n- Having someone else read it for you\n- Presenting it in another format (e.g., video recording)\n\nIf you need assistance preparing this statement, please contact your local Victim Services office.', '[{"name":"courtFileNumber","label":"Court File Number","type":"text","required":true},{"name":"caseName","label":"Case Name","type":"text","required":true},{"name":"victimName","label":"Victim Name","type":"text","required":true},{"name":"accusedName","label":"Accused Name","type":"text","required":true},{"name":"offenceDate","label":"Offence Date","type":"date","required":true},{"name":"offenceLocation","label":"Offence Location","type":"text","required":true},{"name":"emotionalImpact","label":"Emotional Impact","type":"textarea","required":true,"helper":"Describe your feelings and emotional reactions to the crime, such as fear, anxiety, stress, depression, loss of sleep, etc."},{"name":"physicalImpact","label":"Physical Impact","type":"textarea","required":false,"helper":"Describe any physical injuries or symptoms you have experienced as a result of the crime, including any medical treatment required or ongoing health issues."},{"name":"financialImpact","label":"Financial Impact","type":"textarea","required":false,"helper":"Describe any financial losses you have suffered because of the crime, such as property damage, loss of income, medical expenses, therapy costs, etc."},{"name":"relationshipLifestyleImpact","label":"Impact on Relationships and Lifestyle","type":"textarea","required":false,"helper":"Describe how the crime has affected your relationships with family, friends, colleagues, and your daily activities or lifestyle."},{"name":"securityFears","label":"Fears for Security","type":"textarea","required":false,"helper":"Describe any concerns you have about your safety or security as a result of the crime."},{"name":"sentencingViews","label":"Views on Sentencing (Optional)","type":"textarea","required":false,"helper":"If you wish, you may express your views about the sentence.
